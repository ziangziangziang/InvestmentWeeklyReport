## Thesis

The most anticipated event this week will be the Fed's decision on the interest. There should be a HUGE impact on the market on Wednesday afternoon. However, I assume part of the interest cut, if not all of them, has been priced in. SP500 gained 1.57% last week, among them, TSLA showed amazing price gain from 300-ish to 400-ish.

| Energy |             1.42 |         4.77 |           1.29 |
| Financials |             1.38 |         3.08 |          10.72 |
| Health Care |             0.15 |        -0.19 |          -0.61 |
| Industrials |             0.43 |         1.14 |          14.21 |
| Materials |            -0.30 |         0.04 |          10.21 |
| Technology |             3.05 |         2.89 |          14.90 |
| Communication Services |             2.32 |        -0.64 |          19.89 |
| Real Estate |             0.40 |         0.71 |           3.70 |
| Utilities |             2.43 |         3.44 |          10.92 |


In my understanding, the investors are in the FOMO mood. Everyone fears missing out the great opportunity to gain. People will find anying possible to invest, and, exit at the first sign of decline. This behavior is likely to amplify market volatility at Monday and Tuesday.

I anticipate that the investment flows will follow a hype-driven hierarchy, moving from the highly visible, narrative-heavy industries down to less mature but still speculative sectors.

I think the market will experience the enlarged volatility this week. I guess the investment will flow, from top to bottom:
