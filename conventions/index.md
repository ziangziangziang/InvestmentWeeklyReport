title: Conventions
---

This page describes the conventions used across weekly foresee and daily reports: event types, time notation, non-U.S. event labeling, and common abbreviations.

## Conventions
The calendar lists a selected list of events that could contribute to the investment decisions for each period.

I include two types of events in the list:
- Earning Report (ER)
- Data Release (DR)

All the time is in ET. For improved readability, the clock time is represented so that A stands for A.M., and P stands for P.M.

Unless explicitly specified, the event is for the U.S. economy. For events outside of the U.S. economy, they have the format `<time>-<event>-<location>`.
